# Fast-Radio-Burst-Analysis-Tools
This is my first git repository to store python packages I will use
to perform FRB/Pulsar Analysis.
The first package is named frb_stat. This package has two modules:
1) arimp : This imports archive Pulsar/FRB single pulse files and plots a dynamic spectra
2) gfit: This module will fit gaussian functions to individual profiles and get the FWHM 
         of the bursts 
3) edist : This module will convert the raw SNR values into energy (in ergs)
